# Geo-Life-Clef
Predicting the plant species present at a given location is helpful for many biodiversity management and conservation scenarios. Our approach towards the solution is by first merging all the training datasets based on their survey ID, then preprocessing the data and analyzing it further to get a better understanding. 

### Note:
The attached notebook contains the GeoLifeClef Task Submission released by Kaggle. Since the dataset is huge, it hasn't been attached here. In order to view the dataset,
